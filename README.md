# ML-Classification

This repository documents my progress while learning Machine Learning with Python: Classification at Alura. Each notebook corresponds to a specific topic in the Machine Learning course I'm taking.

## Notebooks

1. **[01-Multiclass-Problems.ipynb](https://github.com/devdebdeb/ML-Classificacao/blob/main/01-Multiclass-Problems.ipynb)**
   - How to handle multiclass classification problems using "one-vs-all" and "one-vs-one" strategies.

2. **[02-Model-Optimization.ipynb](https://github.com/devdebdeb/ML-Classificacao/blob/main/02-Model-Optimization.ipynb)**
   - Model evaluation techniques such as cross-validation and ROC curve analysis.

3. **[03-Feature-Selection.ipynb](https://github.com/devdebdeb/ML-Classificacao/blob/main/03-Feature-Selection.ipynb)**
   - Feature selection methods, including LASSO and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).

4. **[04-Combinating-Classifiers.ipynb](https://github.com/devdebdeb/ML-Classificacao/blob/main/04-Combinating-Classifiers.ipynb)**
   - Ensemble learning techniques like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting to enhance model performance.

## About the Course
This course covers various aspects of Machine Learning, including supervised and semi-supervised methods, data preprocessing, model tuning, and more.
